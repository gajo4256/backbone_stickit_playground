- updateM - udpateModel function to restrict when we want model to be updated from the view
- visible - hide desired input field depending on value provided from bound attribute 
- select - bind collecion to select option
- optGroup - optGroup example
- multiSelect - select with multiple choices
- select2 - how to integrate 3rd party library with stickit, in this case with select2
- attr - modify desired input element with specific attribute, in this case with class attribute
- handler - add global handler on app level
- saved_select - how to bind model attribute for select option that was already saved (e.g. saved entitiy on BE). Also how to set the new value again in the desired format of the model if the collection available for select is of a different type.
